Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible,
AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.


## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Hapi](https://hapi.dev) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Postman,postman collection , newman](https://www.postman.com/) - Postman is a very suitable tool for testing an API because it has a relatively complete function as an API caller in making HTTP requests. Even for complex API development, Postman tests can be integrated into CI/CD flows.
## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v15+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm install
cd folder 
npm start-dev(nodemon)
npm start(node folder)
```

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
